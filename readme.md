# LoL-queue-Acceptor-windows
A League Of Legends queue acceptor for windows including .exe file - No installation needed, ready to use. <br>
You can set a notifier on telegram or discord.

# Ready to use match accept League Of Legends.
I was inspired by the lucassmonn code
[accept-queue-lol-telegram](https://github.com/lucassmonn/accept-queue-lol-telegram), and I modify it according to my needs. That I have compiled in order to make it accessible to everyone.

You can use uncompiled version, where you can find the code open to all, check [python version](https://github.com/reusteur73/LoL_auto_queue_acceptor) (uncompiled) for other OS. (But you would need to install all the right packages in the right versions.)
# Antivirus detection

I used [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) to compile the program.
Antivirus programs can mark [programs compiled with py2exe as viruses](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/139190/py2exe-creates-a-virus).  
I advise you to add an exception to windows defender and your antivirus if needed.  
As said above, the uncompiled version is available, the code open to all
